    <abstract>
      <t>This specification details an extension to the JSON Activity 
      Streams serialization to support explicit identification of 
      the audience for a specific activity.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>The Activity Streams specification defines a format for describing
      socially interesting events, or "Activities", about the people and things 
      an individual cares about.</t>
      
      <t>Every Activity has both a Primary and Secondary audience. The Primary
      audience consists of those entities either directly involved in the 
      activity or who "own" the objects involved. The Secondary audience 
      consists of the collection of entities sharing an interest in the 
      activity but who are not directly involved (e.g. "followers").</t>
      
      <t>For instance, suppose a social network of three individuals: Bob, Joe 
      and Jane. Bob and Joe are each friends with Jane but not friends with one 
      another. Bob has chosen to "follow" activities for which Jane is directly 
      involved. Jane shares a file with Joe.</t> 
      
      <t>In this example, Jane and Joe are each directly involved in the 
      file sharing activity and together make up the Primary Audience for
      that event. Bob, having an interest in activities involving Jane, is 
      the Secondary Audience. Knowing this, a system that produces or 
      consumes the activity can more intelligently notify each of the users
      of the event.</t>
      
      <t>The core Activity Streams specification does not define a means of 
      explicitly identifying the Primary or Secondary audience for an event. 
      There are means, based on the verb, actor, object and target of the 
      activity, to infer the primary audience for many types of activities,
      but not all. This specification introduces four optional extension 
      properties for an Activity to explicitly describe the Primary and
      Secondary audience. An activity utilizing these extension properties 
      is hereafter referred to as a "Targeted Activity".</t>

        Secondary audiences. The value of each of these properties when 
        serialized using the JSON format is an array of Objects. The objects 
        can be of any objectType but will typically represent individuals or 
        groups of individuals.</t>

        <section anchor="cc-bcc" title="Public and Private Audiences">
        
          <t>The prototypical use case for Targeted Activities is the 
          publication and redistribution of Activities through an intermediary.
          A event source generates the activity and publishes it to the 
          intermediary which determines the subset of events to display 
          to specific individual users or groups. Such a determination can 
          be made, in part, by identifying the Primary and Secondary Audiences 
          for each activity.</t>

          <t>When the event source generates the activity and specifies values
          for the <spanx style="verb">to</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">cc</spanx> 
          fields, the intermediary SHOULD redistribute
          that event with the values of those fields intact, allowing any 
          entity receiving and processing that entity to see who the activity
          has been targeted to. This is precisely the same model used by the 
          to and cc fields in email systems.</t>
          
          <t>There are situations, however, in which disclosing the identity
          of specific members of the audience may be inappropriate. For instance,
          a user may not wish to let other users know that they are interested
          in various topics, individuals or types of events. To support this
          option, an event source generating an activity MAY use the <spanx style="verb">bto</spanx> and 
          <spanx style="verb">bcc</spanx> properties to list entities to whom the activity should be 
          privately targeted. When the intermediary receives an activity 
          containing these properties, it MUST remove them prior to 
          redistributing the activity. The intermediary MAY insert new "bto" 
          and "bcc" property values containing empty arrays as an indication 
          that a private audience exists without disclosing the specific 
          individual members of that private audience.</t>
          
          <t>The following example illustrates the expected behavior of 
          an intermediary redistributing an activity that has both a 
          public and private audience:</t>
        
          <t>First, the event source generates an activity that is published
          to the intermediary.</t>

        and <spanx style="verb">bcc</spanx> values, 
        and make that activity available to each of the four people 
        identified.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Targeted Activities are subject to the same security considerations
      as all activities. Applications publishing targeted activities to 
      untrusted intermediaries must be aware of the risk that the intermediary 
      may not properly handle the <spanx style="verb">bto</spanx> and 
      <spanx style="verb">bcc</spanx> properties leading to inappropriate 
      disclosure of a targets private audience. Intermediaries and consumers
      of targeted activities must be aware of the potential for spoofing 
      and phishing attacks caused by inappropriately or maliciously targeted
      activities.</t>
